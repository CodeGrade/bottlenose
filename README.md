# Bottlenose

Bottlenose is a web app for managing assignment submission and grading in
computer science courses. It provides a flexible mechanism for automatic grading
of programming assignments.

## Development Environment

Bottlenose is built expecting the following environment:

 * Ubuntu 16.04
 * A BTRFS (or ZFS) filesystem for /var
 * PostgreSQL
 * Ruby + Bundler

For deployment, Phusion Passenger + Nginx is recommended.

## Bottlenose Setup

The goal of this section is to have a working web-server running Bottlenose and
all of it's dependencies. All scripts in this sections start in the
`$BOTTLENOSE` directory unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Basics

Some packages are generally good to have, and needed by many future steps in
the setup process.

```sh
sudo apt-get install build-essential git postgresql libpq-dev
```

### Postgres

```sh
# Switch to the postgres user to create the new bottlenose role.
sudo su - postgres

# Create the bottlenose role for postgres.
createuser -d bottlenose

# Exit back to the vagrant user.
exit
```

If you run into authentication trouble later, you may need to modify
the pg_hba.conf in /etc/postgres/.../ to allow local ident auth.

### Ruby

Best practice for Ruby in development is to use a version manager like
[rvm](http://rvm.io) or rbenv. Once you have the correct version installed, 

```sh
# Install Ruby's package manager "Bundler".
gem install bundler

# Install Bottlenose's dependencies.
# (from the bottlenose directory checked out from git)
bundle install
```

### Running Bottlenose

Bottlenose is mostly a standard Rails app.

Currently the bigest weirdness is the use of delayed job.

```sh
# Get a fresh database
rails db:create
rails db:migrate

# Start delayed job worker.
bin/delayed_job start

# Start the server
rails s

# App should be at localhost:3000, as per usual.
```

### Troubleshooting

**Problem 1**: 

When you run `rails db:create`, and if you get the following error message:

```sh
FATAL:  role "bottlenose" does not exist
Couldn't create database for {"adapter"=>"postgresql", "encoding"=>"unicode", "database"=>"bottlenose_development", "pool"=>5, "username"=>"bottlenose", "password"=>nil}
rake aborted!
ActiveRecord::NoDatabaseError: FATAL:  role "bottlenose" does not exist
```

You will need to create the user (AKA "role") inside PostgreSQL using psql.exe:

```sh
# Start psql.exe
$ psql -d postgres

# Create the user: bottlenose (this should be the application name)
postgres=# create role bottlenose login createdb;

# Quit psql.exe
postgres=# \q
```

Expect terminal to return:

```sh
Created database 'bottlenose_development'
Created database 'bottlenose_test'
```

Then continue by running `rails db:create`.


**Problem 2**: 

If you have successfully started rails server, but recevied this message when you type `localhost:3000` in your browser:

```sh
PG::ConnectionBad at /users/sign_in
could not connect to server: No such file or directory
	Is the server running locally and accepting
	connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
```

You need to start postgres server manually, type the following in your terminal:
```
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start
```

For stoping the server manually, type:
```
pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres stop -s -m fast
```
